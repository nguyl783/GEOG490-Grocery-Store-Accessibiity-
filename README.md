# GEOG490-Grocery-Store-Accessibiity-
Acessibility of Eugene Grocery Stores By Public Transportation
By Anna Jatsura, Haley Loren, Lauren Nguyen, and Kent Williams


#### Summary:
We want to focus on accessibility issues locally in Eugene. Primarily, we want to gain a better understanding of how accessible grocery stores are through public transit, potentially including PeaceHealth bike hubs, EMX, and bus lines. This will be done by obtaining network data in the Eugene area and data from PeaceHealth and LTD (Lane Transit District).


#### Objective:
Determine and highlight the areas of Eugene that are of low accessibility to grocery stores, utilizing transportation, network, and census data. 

#### Datasets used:   
https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=da445548bb844a3ca0ec646dd1a714e1   
https://mapping.eugene-or.gov/search   
https://www.eugene-or.gov/1238/Full-Service-Grocery   
https://mapping.eugene-or.gov/   
(more to come...)   

#### Python Packages:    
https://github.com/gis-ops/routingpy     
https://geopandas.org/   
https://pandas.pydata.org/   
https://numpy.org/   
(etc...)   

#### Approach:
- using census data to look at commuting time by car and walking 
- accessibility by public transit (EMX, LTD busses) and bikes (what is available by data) network data
- rating grocery stores by price & quality
- using network data to look at driving time from businesses to grocery stores

Expected Outcomes:
- Heat map of accessibility of grocery stores
    - looking at accessibility by bus, foot, and car 
- Table that includes statistics showing accessibility (details TBD)
