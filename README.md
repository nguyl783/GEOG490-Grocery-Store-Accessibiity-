# GEOG490-Grocery-Store-Accessibiity-
Acessibility of Eugene Grocery Stores By Public Transportation
By Anna Jatsura, Haley Loren, Lauren Nguyen, and Kent Williams


Summary: We want to focus on accessibility issues locally in Eugene. Primarily, we want to gain a better understanding of how accessible grocery stores are through public transit, potentially including PeaceHealth bike hubs, EMX, and bus lines. This will be done by obtaining network data in the Eugene area and data from PeaceHealth and LTD (Lane Transit District).
