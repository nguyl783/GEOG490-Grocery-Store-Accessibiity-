# GEOG490-Grocery-Store-Accessibiity-
By Kent Williams


We want to focus on accessibility issues locally in Eugene. Primarily, we want to gain a better understanding of how accessible grocery stores are through public transit, including PeaceHealth bike hubs, EMX, and bus lines. This will be done by obtaining network data in the Eugene area and data from PeaceHealth and LTD (Lane Transit District). We will need to obtain a dataset that contains grocery stores for the Eugene area.
