# GEOG490-Grocery-Store-Accessibiity-
Acessibility of Eugene Grocery Stores By Public Transportation
By Anna Jatsura, Haley Loren, Lauren Nguyen, and Kent Williams


Summary: We want to focus on accessibility issues locally in Eugene. Primarily, we want to gain a better understanding of how accessible grocery stores are through public transit, potentially including PeaceHealth bike hubs, EMX, and bus lines. This will be done by obtaining network data in the Eugene area and data from PeaceHealth and LTD (Lane Transit District).


Objective: Determine and highlight the areas of Eugene that are of low accessibility to grocery stores, utilizing transportation, network, and census data. 

Datasets used:

(more to come...)

Python Packages:

Approach:
- census data looking at commuting by car; distances from block group, etc. 
- assesbility by bus, car, bikes (what is available by data) network data
- rating grocery stores by price & quiality 

Expected Outcomes:
- Heat map of accessibility of grocery stores
    - looking at accessibility by bus, foot, and car 
    - using network data instead of Euclidean distance to get more accurate representations
